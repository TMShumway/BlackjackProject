## Blackjack Project

### Overview
Welcome to my BlackJack Project. This project simulates a basic BlackJack game.
It is implemented with a limited subset of the most common rules. With that in
mind, certain features such as splitting, betting, and soft and hard hands will
be implemented in a future version.

### How To Run

This program is a simple java program. As such you are able to run it by opening
the BlackJackApp.java file in an IDE or terminal and run using the appropriate
commands.

### Technologies Used

* Java
* Enums
* Object-Oriented Design
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Loops
* Interfaces
* If else statements
* Switch statements
* Input validation
* Overriding built in methods

### Lessons Learned

This project was absolutely the most challenging project I have attempted. I
learned how to use enums, and they definitely came in handy with handling the
card suits and card ranks. Throughout the project I tried my best to approach
everything with OOP in mind. For future revisions of this project I plan to
implement a player and house class, and a purse in each of them which can be
used for betting. Doing this would move the PlayerHand and DealerHand into those
aforementioned new classes.

I will admit, though I believe this code meets all of the necessary requirements
as is, I am not satisfied with it. After looking over it, I feel that there is
a lot that can be consolidated and further simplified. I need to spend more time
practicing building code that not works but is also working efficiently.

I also have an unfinished card template that needs further work. In its current
for it does indeed print out ascii versions of the cards, however, with the time
frame given I could not get it to print multiple cards left to right instead of
top to bottom. Completing this in a future revision will enhance the visual value
of the game.
